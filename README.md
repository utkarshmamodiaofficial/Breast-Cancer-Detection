# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This is a small project to test custom algorithms on the dataset for breast cancer. In this repository you will find necessary information to get you going with these 3 classifcation algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest)

# Dataset
This is Wisconsin Dataset for breast cancer but you will find it inside the root folder of this project.

# Install
Install Jupyter Notebook
Supported Python version
     - Python version used in this project: 3.5+
# Libraries used
Pandas 0.18.0 Numpy 1.10.4 Matplotlib 1.5.1 Scikit-learn 0.17.1 Seaborn

# Code
Each algorithm tested (or version of it) has its own separate .ipynb file. Each file has its name to tell you what algorithm is used.

# Run
To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).
